# WC GO

This is a simple word counter CLI app written in Go that replicates (with a few twitches) the functionality of the `wc` command in linux.

We have the ability to use various CLI Flags in order to customize the output of the word counter. These flags include:

> If no flag is passed then all values are shown.

- `-l`: Count the number of lines in the input.
- `-w`: Count the number of words in the input.
- `-c`: Count the number of characters (bytes) in the input.

> The flags can be used in any given order.
